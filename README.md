###Playtest Mid-Dev
Jacques

I am having a good time with this game but there isn't really much to do. The movement is a 
bit choppy and I get stuck on the walls a lot
- likes the colors and the sprites
- intuitively seems to know how to navigate but doesn't seem to have any sort of objective
- played for a bit and then got bored

This isn't really my type of game. I'm just not really super into something like this
and I don't know what regular show is. Should I just be walking around? I can't really do anything anywhere?
- had a hard time using the cart
- didn't really move smoothly
- spot in the lake area where character gets stuck 

###Playtest Post-Dev

OMG I love the intro screen, especially the font it's so cool! I like that the
sound is synced up. I enjoyed gathering the leaves and the cart is a really cool touch.
- seemed to clearly understand needing to collect leaves due to the score being incremented
