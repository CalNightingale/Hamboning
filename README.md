###Playtest Mid-Dev
Jacques

I am having a good time with this game but there isn't really much to do. The movement is a 
bit choppy and I get stuck on the walls a lot
- likes the colors and the sprites
- intuitively seems to know how to navigate but doesn't seem to have any sort of objective
- played for a bit and then got bored


Leo

This isn't really my type of game. I'm just not really super into something like this
and I don't know what regular show is. Should I just be walking around? I can't really do anything anywhere?
- had a hard time using the cart
- didn't really move smoothly
- spot in the lake area where character gets stuck 

Luca

Gave pretty similar answers to Jacques, just kind of moved around and didn't really do much.
Was amused by the cart but did not hold his attention very long. Played for about 30 seconds before
saying it was cool, seemed fine. Wished there was a tad more to do.

Angie

Seemed pretty unfamiliar with computer games in general, needed instruction for using the arrow 
keys to move. Once she figured it out though was thoroughly excited about the map that we created.
Spent a while exploring the bounds of the map and playing in and around the trees and rocks. Could've 
probably just moved around in the world for a while and had a good time.

###Playtest Post-Dev

Molly

OMG I love the intro screen, especially the font it's so cool! I like that the
sound is synced up. I enjoyed gathering the leaves and the cart is a really cool touch.
- seemed to clearly understand needing to collect leaves due to the score being incremented
- was bummed when all of the leaves were collected so she started a new game and played again!

I used to watch regular show growing up and so this is really really nostalgic for me.
I'm going to have Summertime stuck in my head for the next week loi. I would've had fun if there
were more minigamse or other things, but I also think its kinda hilarious that the only thing you ever
really do is collect leaves and ride the golf cart. That's kinda how the show is!

James

Had seen one episode of RS, so didn't really know the characters but understood the reference.
Wasn't super excited to to find places of interest or do anything, but did make sure to collect all of the
leaves. Seemed to find the song annoying and muted it after a bit. Suggested that we implement some more
actions for the characters to do, or some sort of mech like Lego Star Wars in which you can switch
characters between Mordecai and Rigby.

Noah

Saw the show a few times and really loved the intro screen syncing with the beat, and use of font. Thought
that it was a really sweet ode to the show and that we should find some way to share this with people so everyone
can play it. Didn't really have any helpful suggestions other than saying that he wanted to be able to 
go to Margaret's Cafe / go in the house
